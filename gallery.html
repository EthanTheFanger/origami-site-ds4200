            <h3>About folding techniques</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most fascinating aspects of origami is that despite the incredible complexityof models that can be created, almost all origami relies on just a couple of fundamental folds. The two most basic folds are the mountain fold and valley fold, which are essentially the same fold viewed from opposite sides. A mountain fold creates a peak like a mountain ridge, while a valley fold creates a dip downward. These two simple folds form the foundation of virtually every origami model ever created. The reverse fold is another essential technique that involves changing the direction of an existing crease, inverting a flap or section of paper. This fold is crucial for creating features like beaks, tails, and limbs in animal models. The crimp fold combines the mountain and valley folds in sequence to create a zig-zag, which is often used to add angles or joints to a model. Understanding and mastering basic folds is the key to being able to follow origami diagrams.

                Beyond these fundamental folds, there are a few other important and advanced techniques that origami folders use regularly. The squash fold opens up a flap and flatten the paper in a specific way, creating new creases and changing the paper's configuration. The petal fold is a more complex maneuver that brings multiple points together, often used in creating flower petals. The sink fold pushes a point inward, which can be tricky to do cleanly. The rabbit ear fold creates a pointed flap by bringing three corners together at once. What's interesting is that even the most complex origami models, those that might take hours to complete, are still just combinations and variations of these basic folding techniques. The complexity comes not from inventing new types of folds, but from the creative sequencing and combination of these fundamental moves. This is what makes origami so accessible to everyone.
